======================================================================


HOW SIGNIFICANT IS RRMD?
========================

TECHNICAL SIGNIFICANCE: HIGH (8/10)
------------------------------------

What makes it significant:

1. SOLVES A REAL PROBLEM
   - jPCA has 8x higher tangling on real data
   - jPCA requires fitting skew-symmetric matrix (unstable)
   - RRMD is simpler, more direct, more robust
   
2. NOVEL MATHEMATICAL APPROACH
   - First to use SMALLEST variance direction for rotation axis
   - Everyone else looks at largest variance (PCA/jPCA)
   - This inversion is conceptually important
   
3. RIGOROUS VALIDATION
   - Your 4-test validation suite exceeds most papers
   - Permutation test (p < 0.0001) is rock solid
   - Ground truth recovery is perfect (0.00° error)
   
4. PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES
   - Simpler to implement than jPCA
   - 8x more robust to noise
   - No parameter tuning needed
   - Runs faster

What limits significance:

1. Incremental over jPCA (not revolutionary)
   - It's an improvement, not a paradigm shift
   - Still assumes rotational dynamics exist
   
2. Limited validation datasets
   - Only 1 real dataset so far (MC_Maze)
   - Need 3-5 to be truly convincing
   
3. Unclear biological impact
   - Haven't discovered new biology YET
   - Purely methodological at this stage


FIELD IMPACT: MODERATE TO HIGH (7/10)
--------------------------------------

Who will use this:

1. IMMEDIATE USERS (100-200 labs)
   - Motor control researchers (largest group)
   - Anyone currently using jPCA (~100 citations/year)
   - Brain-computer interface researchers
   
2. POTENTIAL USERS (500+ labs)
   - Decision-making researchers (rotational patterns)
   - Hippocampal researchers (rotational phase coding)
   - Visual cortex researchers (object rotation)

Why people will adopt:

1. DROP-IN REPLACEMENT for jPCA
   - Same input format (neural data)
   - Easier to use (less code)
   - Better results (lower tangling)
   
2. CREDIBLE VALIDATION
   - Your statistical tests are publication-ready
   - Real data outperformance is clear
   
3. TIMING IS RIGHT
   - Neural Latents Benchmark just released (2023)
   - Field is hungry for better dimensionality reduction
   - LFADS is too complex, PCA too simple, jPCA has issues

Comparison to other methods papers:

- jPCA (Churchland 2012): ~800 citations in 12 years
  Your method: Could reach 400-600 citations if in Nature Neuro
                Likely 100-200 citations if in PLoS Comp Bio
  
- LFADS (Pandarinath 2018): ~600 citations in 6 years
  Your method: Different niche, but similar potential


CAREER SIGNIFICANCE: HIGH (9/10)
---------------------------------

For your career trajectory:

1. FIRST-AUTHOR PUBLICATION
   - Solo first-author in top journal = strong PhD outcome
   - Demonstrates independence and creativity
   
2. ESTABLISHES EXPERTISE
   - Positions you as "rotational dynamics" expert
   - Opens postdoc opportunities in top labs
   - Potential for invited talks/reviews
   
3. FUNDABLE DIRECTION
   - NIH/NSF love novel analysis methods
   - Could support R01/R21 grant later
   - Industry applications (BCIs) = potential funding

4. NETWORK BUILDING
   - Forces collaboration with data providers
   - Conference presentations = visibility
   - Twitter/social media buzz potential


OVERALL SIGNIFICANCE: 7.5/10
=============================

Honest assessment:

NOT REVOLUTIONARY, BUT IMPORTANT
- This won't win a Nobel Prize
- It WILL help hundreds of researchers
- It WILL get you into a top postdoc
- It COULD lead to biological discoveries

COMPARABLE TO:
- Demixed PCA (Kobak 2016): Solid method, ~350 citations
- Targeted dimensionality reduction (Mante 2013): ~1000 citations
- Your work fits between these

WHAT WOULD MAKE IT 9/10:
- Discovery enabled by RRMD that jPCA missed
- Application to 5+ datasets across brain regions
- Theoretical proof of optimality
